✨ _Mission Goals_ ✨

- teach my pug dog HTML using [pug syntax](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/tree/master/packages/pug)
- could my dog (in-theory) achieve turing completeness with HTML and SVGs?
- are there code editors for dogs? can my pug use the tab button?
- he needs more than tab? vim motions for pugs?
- whats happens when his code fails? 
- does he debug it or do i?
