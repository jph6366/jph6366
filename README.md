## Hi there 👋
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jph6366)
- ⚙️🐧📂🗨️🆓 I’m currently working on open source contributions and developing _standard & realtime & offline_ **geographic & spatial data components**...
    -  web_ solutions that conform to modern web, graphics, and geospatial standards
    - supporting configurations with popular client-side & server-side languages and frameworks.
    - executing and auto-scaling in **OCI containers** and porting through **WebAssembly modules**.
    - automating deployment for data **assets**, **analysis**, **sensors**, and **resources** for e2e applications for public benefit.
- ⚕️🪖🛟🪸🩻🛰️ Dedicated to creating or contributing to open source software for medical & emergency services, disaster preparedness, coastal resilience, and open source (geo)spatial projects.
    - Supporting National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) through the [Geospatial Data Act of 2018 (GDA)](https://www.fws.gov/law/geospatial-data-act-2018), advocating for [accessibly formatted data and data systems](https://voltrondata.com/codex/a-new-frontier) and improve the overall quantity and quality of reusable data; collaborating interests across stakeholder communities.
